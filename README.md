# LearnMD

**LearnMD** is an open, Markdown-based format for writing learning content — lessons, examples, summaries, and inline knowledge checkpoints.

A `.learn.md` file is valid Markdown — readable by humans, versionable in Git, and renderable by any compatible learning player.

## Quick example

```markdown
---
lang: en
tags: [python, variables]
estimated_time: 15min
---

# Python Variables

A variable is a named reference to a value in memory.

## Assignment

```python
age = 25
name = "Alice"
```

> [!tip]
> Use descriptive names: `student_count` is clearer than `n`.

```quiz
? What operator assigns a value in Python?
- [x] =
- [ ] ==
- [ ] :=
```

## Summary

- Variable = name + value
- Python infers types dynamically
- Names are case-sensitive: `Age` ≠ `age`
```

## Key features

- **Instruction-first** — explain concepts, walk through examples, guide learners step by step
- **Inline checkpoints** — embed knowledge checks directly via ` ```quiz ` blocks (delegated to [QuizMD](https://github.com/neuroneo-md/quizmd))
- **Progressive levels** — plain `.learn.md` works anywhere; frontmatter adds metadata; special blocks add rich UI
- **Math support** — LaTeX via KaTeX, auto-detected
- **AI-native** — designed to be generated and validated by AI assistants via MCP
- **Git-native** — plain text, diff-friendly, works in any repository

## The teach → test stack

LearnMD and QuizMD are complementary:

| | LearnMD | QuizMD |
|---|---|---|
| Purpose | Teach | Assess |
| File | `.learn.md` | `.quiz.md` |
| Standalone | ✓ | ✓ |
| Together | Embeds QuizMD checkpoints | Provides scored checkpoints |

## Specification

See [SPEC.md](./SPEC.md) for the full format specification.

## Implementations

| Project | Type | Link |
|---------|------|------|
| neuroneo.md | Web player + API + MCP server | [neuroneo.md](https://www.neuroneo.md) |
